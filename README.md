# CLTuneDemos
Demo programs showing how to use [CLTune](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLTune) for autotuning OpenCL kernels.

At present, the only demo is a median filter but I hope to add more.

## Building the demos

The following needs to be installed first to build these demos:

- CLTune
- C++ compiler supporting C++11 (tested using MinGW-w64)
- An OpenCL runtime (tested using Intel and AMD CPU runtimes and NVIDIA's GPU runtime on Windows 7.
- CMake 3.1.0 or later.

After you've installed the pre-requisites, create a folder next to CLTuneDemos, e.g. CLTuneDemos_build and cd into this directory.
This is the directory where CMake will will generate the necessary makefiles and where the demos will actually be built.
Now run

	cmake ../CLTuneDemos

to generate the makefiles (or equivalent for your compiler). Afterwards, if you're using the GNU make tools (e.g. MinGW-w64 or on Linux) run

	make

to build the demos.

I've also included `make_eclipse_projects.bat` for making an Eclipse CDT project from which to build the demos.
This is a personal preference of mine and I've added the script in case anyone else wants to generate project files for doing development work on this repository.
You can select the type of projects that get generated by using the `-G` command line option in the call to CMake.

## TODO

- Add more demos.
